# PPE_Detection
Personal Protective Equipment can be detected and recognised using this project.
Using OpenCV and a model (that I trained based on YOLO8l version), this project is able to detect and recognise if a person has worn personal protective equipment(ppe) like mask, helmet, safety vest etc. I have provided a model*(ppe.pt) that I trained based on YOLO8l using Google Collab.has be provided but you can use large version. Yolo is a pre-trained model. It is a popular object detection model. Using GPU instead of CPU to run the code is encouraged to improve the speed.Good luck.
*the model file(ppe.pt) is too large(over 25mb) to be uploaded here, email me at felixronoh258@gmail.com so that I can share.
